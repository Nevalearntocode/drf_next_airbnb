# About Me:
Hi, my name is Minh TÃ¢m 
    <br>
I'm learning to make full-stack websites, currently juggling some personal projects and polishing up my resume for the job hunt.
    <br>
    <br>
Throughout my coding journey, content creators like [Dennis Ivy](https://www.youtube.com/@DennisIvy), [Code with Antonio](https://www.youtube.com/@codewithantonio), and [Dave Gray](https://www.youtube.com/@DaveGrayTeachesCode) have been incredibly helpful. I can't imagine the amount of knowledge and effort these people put into their content to teach us - self-taught developers everything, expecting nothing in return. I was shocked and felt incredibly lucky at the same time.
